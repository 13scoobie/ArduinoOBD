This is the source code for the Arduino OBD-II data logger, which displays (on a 320x240 TFT LCD shield) and records (to a SD card) GPS and a set of OBD-II data in the form of text-based CSV format file or more compacted binary file.

To compile the code with Arduino IDE, please copy all library files from the libraries directory to Arduino's libraries directory.

To use the project file (megalogger.cbp) to compile and upload, please download CodeBlocks Arduino Edition (http://arduinodev.com/codeblocks).

The source code is distributed under GPL license.
